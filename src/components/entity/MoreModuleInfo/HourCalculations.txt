ModuleEffort was a potential way of storing the total effort. However, it would need to be repopulated if credits or size changed. I was unsure about it when I added this field. Perhaps we should delete it as it could get out of sync with the formula.
 
ModuleEffort = ModuleLeadingEffort + LecturingEffort + WorkshopEffort + MarkingEffort


ModuleLeadingEffort = MAX(LeadingMinimum, LeadingMultiplier * ModuleSize) // There is a minimum amount which increased with the module size.

LeadingMinimum = 50 // I just made these up!!

LeadingMultiplier = 0.3

LecturingEffort = LecturingMultiplier * IF(ModuleCredit=15, 22 weeks, 44 weeks) * 2 hours/week

LecturingMultiplier = 2 // Prep for lecturing 

WorkshopEffort  = WorkshopMultiplier * IF(ModuleCredit=15, 22 weeks, 44 weeks) * 2 hours/week * NumberOfWeeklyWorkshops

WorkshopMultiplier = 1.5 // Prep for workshops

NumberOfWeeklyWorkshops = ROUNDUP( ModuleSize / WorkshopSize )

WorkshopSize = 100

MarkingEffort = ModuleSize * MarkingTimePerStudent

MarkingTimePerStudent = 1 // One hour

 
LeadingMinimum, LeadingMultiplier, LecturingMultiplier , WorkshopMultiplier, WorkshopSize and MarkingTimePerStudent are all examples of business logic parameters which should be stored in a JS file somewhere imported where needed.
